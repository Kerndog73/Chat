This is a self-signed certificate generated using this:
openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout tls/private_key.key -out tls/certificate.crt

Country Name: AU
State or Province Name: SA
Locality Name: Adelaide
Organization Name: Indiana Kernick
Common Name: localhost

On macOS, open the certificate in Keychain Access and trust it. In Chrome,
you'll have to "Proceed to localhost (unsafe)" once. It still doesn't show the
green padlock icon but I think this is as close as I can get without going
through the whole process of getting a proper server.
