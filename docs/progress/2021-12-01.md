Today has been a bit of a lazy day but here I am!

I've been doing a lot of CSS work for the past few days so I think I can start
working on the features that the interface promises. Although I've just realised
that I'm still missing the dropdown menus which are required for implementing
most of the new features. The only thing I can do without dealing with CSS is
the online/offline status in the user list. The screenshots so far have been
fake. That part isn't actually functional yet. After I've done that I guess I'll
work on the dropdowns.

Another thing that I've been putting off is refactoring the socket code. It's a
mess. It's always been a mess and I really need to sort it out but I just keep
tacking things onto it. All of that complexity is in two files. It probably
won't have quite the same impact as another task that I was putting off (CSS)
but I still need to do it at some point. It's embarrassing.

I think I'll probably spend most of tomorrow sorting out the socket code and
also completing the user online/offline status as well. The basic concept is
there but it doesn't handle changing between groups. It's also kind of a mess.
