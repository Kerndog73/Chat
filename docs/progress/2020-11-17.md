Warp seems like a good choice for a HTTP server in Rust.
A chat app would result in a lot of interesting server code.
This actually seems like a really fun idea.
I’m itching to get started!
Obviously this isn’t a new or original idea but **that’s not the point.**

Creating an API to allow for chat bots will be really interesting.

Should develop it in stages.
1. **Design!** Know exactly what you’re aiming for before you start.
2. Start with the server using Rust and Warp and a bare bones client page.
3. Then flesh out the client with Angular and TypeScript.
4. At some point, extend the feature set. Maybe an API for chat bots.
5. Maybe I could also make an iOS app to learn more about iOS development.

After I’ve written about the end product in as much detail as possible, divide it into stages and estimate a timeline. It should be easy to tell my progress. I should be able to mark things off a checklist.
