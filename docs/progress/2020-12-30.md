I finally stopped putting it off. I spent the whole day working on the CSS and
I'm really proud of this now. It looks so much better than it did before. It
looks very similar to Discord! If I show this to someone, I'll be able to say
"remind you of anything...?".

There's quite a bit of redundant CSS (some copy-and-pasting) that I'll need to
deal with. I'm also not done. I still need to do the login page and the dialog
boxes. The dialog boxes are the only place where I'm really using the most
Bootstrap. I think the only part of Bootstrap that I'll actually end up using is
the reboot module. I found that Bootstrap mostly just got in my way.

By doing the CSS, I worked out the final set of features that I want to
implement. Which is good and bad. Good because I know what I'm doing. Bad
because it's a little more than I planned a few days ago. I'll list them here.

**Group menu**
- [x] Invite people
- [ ] Rename group
- [ ] Leave group
- [ ] Delete group
- [x] Create channel

**Channel menu**
- [ ] Rename channel
- [x] Delete channel

**Group list**
- [x] Create group

**User menu**
- [ ] Rename user
- [ ] Logout
- [ ] Delete user

**User list**
- [ ] Online status

There's also the menus themselves that I need to do as well. I think I can use
Bootstrap (or use Popper directly) for doing those. The features themselves
aren't really that difficult to implement on the server side (famous last 
words). It's just a lot of client side UI work.

Another minor thing, I'm not sure what the channel creation button should look
like. I could make it like the group create button, or I could bury it in the
group menu. I'm not really sure.
