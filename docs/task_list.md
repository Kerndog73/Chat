- [x] **[1]** Report
    - Describe this whole project. The challenges and problems faced, how I
      overcame those challenges, the skills I learnt, how I applied those 
      skills, some things I might do better next time (better planning from the
      start and also keeping notes of my progress).
    - This has a high priority but it must be completed last.
    - Some differences between this and a real app. The things that were
      simplified in order to stop this project from taking a year.
      *"a real app would do this"*
    - Describe how the app works. The technical details that make it function.
    - A low hanging fruit is the ER diagram.
    - This may end up being part of the report or be a separate document.
- [x] **[2]** Create groups
    - A user can create a new group, setting a unique name and a picture.
- [x] **[2]** Invite users to groups
    - Any member of a group may invite other users to that group.
    - An invitation is a link. Anyone with the link can join the group from
      within 24 hours of the link being created.
- [x] **[2]** Navigate between groups
    - Once the user is within one group, how do they go to another group? Adopt
      the discord approach and have a list down the side of the page.
- [-] **[3]** Refactoring
    - There are a handful of TODOs relating to code quality and cleanliness.
    - The socket code on both the client and server is getting worse with every
      new feature.
    - This isn't the sort of task that can ever really be ticked off.
- [-] **[3]** User interface polish
    - As of writing, the UI is kind of ugly and boring.
    - Remember that Bootstrap isn't meant to solve everything. You'll still need
      to write a lot of CSS yourself.
    - Progress has been made but the login page and also the dialog boxes need
      some work.
    - Like refactoring, you can't really tick this off. It's ongoing and there
      are always tweaks that can be made.
- [x] **[3]** Handle *lots* of messages
    - Currently, the user isn't able to scroll back past the 50 most recent
      messages.
    - Older messages should be removed as newer messages appear.
- [x] **[4]** Handle disconnected state better
    - Maybe a show a countdown when the client is trying to reconnect.
    - Maybe hide everything while disconnected.
    - Switching between groups involves disconnecting briefly so that will
      need to be considered.
    - A related issue is handling errors. If something unexpected happens like a
      a database error then we should show a generic "something went wrong"
      message.
    - I explored this and I think the way we currently do it is pretty good.
- [x] **[4]** Rename channels
    - Any member of a group can rename channels within the group.
    - The new channel name must be unique within the group.
- [x] **[4]** Rename groups (including changing the picture)
    - Any member of a group can change the name or picture of that group.
    - The new name must be unique.
- [x] **[4]** Rename users (including changing the picture)
    - A user can change their name or picture.
    - The new name must be unique.
- [x] **[5]** Delete user
    - All of a user's messages would need to be updated on each client. This
      would probably use the same mechanism as the "edit message" feature so if
      we implement one of these features, we should implement them both.
- [x] **[5]** Delete group
    - This will delete all messages and forcefully kick all clients.
- [x] **[5]** Leave group
    - There could be multiple clients logged into the same user so all clients
      would need to be forcefully kicked.
    - The user's messages in the group will be anonymized.
- [x] **[5]** Logout
    - This would essentially involve deleting the session cookie and then load
      the login page.
    - The server only needs to set the expiration date of the cookie to some
      date in the past.
- [x] **[5]** Simple notifications
    - If the page is loaded but not visible, show a notification when a message
      arrives.
    - [`Notification on mdn`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notifications_API/Using_the_Notifications_API).
    - [`Notification standard`](https://notifications.spec.whatwg.org/)

## Maybe features

Features that I probably won't implement but, I don't know, maybe.

- [ ] Background notifications
    - Users should get desktop notifications for messages sent in all groups
      that theyâ€™re a member of.
    - We'd need to use a service worker to maintain an SSE connection. The whole
      thing would be completely separate from the web socket code that we have.
- [ ] Full featured notifications
    - To really implement this feature properly, we would probably need to add
      ability to mention users and configure notifications (e.g. just get
      notifications for mentions).
- [ ] Binary format to replace JSON
    - Using a binary format would improve server performance and reduce
      bandwidth usage.
    - This might increase client complexity and it's unclear whether this will
      have a positive or negative impact on client performance.
    - It's a lot of work for an improvement that's difficult to see.
    - Some relevant resources are
      [`TextEncoder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextEncoder)
      and
      [`TextDecoder`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder)
- [ ] Markdown message formatting
    - The most bare-minimum subset of markdown.
    - Bold, italic, inline-code, link. That's it.
- [ ] Delete messages
    - A user can select a message that they wrote and delete it
    - Messages from deleted users cannot be deleted because no-one owns them.
      Although you could say that anyone can delete them...
- [ ] Edit messages
    - A user can select a message that they wrote and edit it.
    - Messages from deleted users cannot be edited because no-one owns them.

## Simplifications

Things like will probably make things easier for myself in some way. This often
means sacrificing a feature or two. A real app wouldn't make these sacrifices.
These are sort of the opposite of _maybe features_. They make things easier for
me while taking something away from the user.

- [ ] Users can only connect to a group once
    - A user couldn't have multiple tabs open with the same group in them.
- [ ] Users can only connect to any group once
    - A user couldn't have multiple tabs open with different groups in them.
    - This would result in there being a one-to-one relationship between
      connections and users so the `UserID` could be merged with the `ConnID`.
- [x] Messages by a user are anonymized when they leave a group
- [x] Use a `textarea` instead of `contenteditable` for message sender
    - Users could still format messages using markdown but they won't be able to
      see the formatting until the message is sent.
