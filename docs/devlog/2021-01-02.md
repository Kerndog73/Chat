I spent the first half of the day trying to deal with the background color
bleed on images. I need to composite the image onto a solid background color,
and then clip it. Seems like a simple task but I've been unable to do it with
CSS or SVG. No matter what I try, the browser is clipping the background and the
image separately and then compositing those together. It seems like the only way
to do this on the client side would be to use JavaScript.

I used the canvas to do the job and it's finally perfect. By that I mean, the
appearance is perfect. The performance is suboptimal. The client is doing
something that should really be done on the server. I've just given myself more
work to do! This also isn't want I was planning on doing today.

Initially, this wasn't going to be the only project I do during the holidays but
it's beginning to seem like I won't have time for anything else. This is turning
into a really fun project so I don't really mind.

I've been working on the user list and I think I'm starting to see the right
design emerging. I realised that it's possible for an event to happen between
the page loading and the socket connection being established. We could avoid
this by requesting the channel list and user list using the socket. We already
have to do this when changing groups.

I had no idea the user status list would be this complicated when I started
working on it. I just thought it would be an extra little thing.
