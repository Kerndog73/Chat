Refactoring.

I've been putting off dealing with the socket code for so long. It's difficult
to find the motivation to do it because there is no obvious benefit to doing it.
Users aren't going to see the code.

Before I implement any more features, I'm going to refactor the socket code.

I found that it didn't change too much. I looked through it, added some comments
and move some stuff around. It's still two files on the server. Whenever I try
to split it up into more files, I run into something: Rust's module system. The
problem is probably that I don't understand it fully or don't know how to
structure my code around it. It seems to be forcing me to write code in a
certain way but I'm not sure exactly how it wants me to structure the code. It's
weird!

I also realised that the socket handling code is complex. You can't really get
rid of that complexity. You can try to wrap it up in layers of abstraction but
ultimately, the complexity is still there.

I feel like I've done enough refactoring today. I want to implement features!

The next logical step seems to be dropdown menus. Lack of dropdown menus is a 
blocker for many features. I'll start simple. I'll show a better looking tooltip
over the group icons to show group names.

I decided to use Popper directly instead of using Bootstrap. This makes it
easier to customize and also allows me to make the JavaScript footprint as small
as possible.

I created the dropdown menu that appears under the group title and I'm pretty
happy with it. It has five buttons but only two are functional at the moment.
With this in place I can start implementing more features.
