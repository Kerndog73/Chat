There's still a lot of work to do on the CSS so I'll keep working on that today.
I'll try to deal with the mess that I left yesterday. There's a lot of
redundancy and repetition. I'd also like to define the color scheme in one
place.

...and that's what I did. The CSS got a massive cleanup. I also used the
Bootstrap grayscale color scheme and that's a big improvement. If I never worked
on this again, I'd at least be proud of the CSS!
