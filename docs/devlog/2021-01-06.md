Here it is. The day I've been waiting for.

**IMAGE HOSTING!**

So I'll start by manually adding the existing images to the server and fetching
them from the client. Then once that's working, I'll work on uploading and
optimizing them.

This turned out to be pretty simple. Instead of getting the image URL from
somewhere, we derive it from the group ID or user ID.

Beyond this point are where things get tricky. I removed the group picture URLs
from the database. Creating groups is broken. There's no way to set the group
picture. When I remove user picture URLs from the database, signup will break
but I think login should still work.

I want to show the user a preview of their image. I also don't think it's a good
idea to give URLs to the server and have the server download something from
who-knows-where. The user will choose an image, then they'll see a preview with
the background color, the right size and the rounded corners. After that, the
image will be uploaded to the server.

If the user is logging into the google account for the first time (signup) then
I might show a preview there too. Even though the URL is coming from a trusted
source (Google), we'll still have to apply the background color and I'm not keen
on doing that on the server. I'm not really sure about the specifics of this.
I haven't really touched the auth code in a while.

I'm thinking about what happens to a user's messages when they leave a group.
I haven't implementing leaving a group yet. If the messages stay intact, it
would mean that a group could contain messages by users that aren't members of
the group. So the user info cache would need to stay, along with the api/user
endpoint.

Anonymizing the messages (similar to what happens when a user is deleted) would
simplify things. The user info cache could be removed and the user list could be
used instead.

Perhaps when a user leaves a group, the group membership remains but in a "left"
state. I can't think of a better word than "left"! So in this case, the user is
not a member but their name is fetched. Although, fetching the names of all
users that have left a group is probably not very efficient because they're
unlikely to be in the most recent messages.

When a user is deleted, clients of members of a group that they've left would
need to be updated. We would need to either anonymize messages when they leave
or keep the "left" state in the membership as described above.

I don't think anonymizing messages on leave is a good idea. It's not very user
friendly. A user could leave and come back and then all of their messages have
been anonymized. 

I just realized that what I'm doing today could just be making this more
difficult for myself. I'm simplifying one little thing by making something else
much more complicated. I'm not sure if I should go on. I'll think about the pros
and cons of this whole operation.

**Pros:**
 - Image URLs can be derived from IDs and thus don't need to be stored.
 - Images can be optimized and processed ahead of time (instead of on the client
   each time they're loaded).
 - Images can have their cache headers set appropriately.

**Cons:**
 - The client needs a UI for uploading images to the server.
 - The server needs to receive these images and optimize them.
 - Signup/login needs to be reworked to download and process the images from
   Google.

The cons are mostly more work for me to do and the problems I'm having are with
things that aren't related. What happens when a user leaves a group has nothing
to do with where the images are coming from.

Leaving all that aside. Right now I need to work uploading images. I'll start
with the group creation dialog. The dialog is also used for renaming groups but
I'm not too sure how that's going to fit into this. We might want separate
dialogs for changing the name and changing the picture. For the moment, I'll
just leave renaming broken and focus on creation.

Dealing with multipart form data on the server side is a bit involved but I got
there in the end.

Ok I think I have it working.
1. The user uploads the file using the file input.
2. We call URL.createObjectURL on this and put it into an img tag.
3. When it loads, we draw it onto a canvas.
4. The canvas is converted to a blob and then the blob is converted to a URL.
5. The URL is shown to the user as a preview.
6. When the user clicks the create button, the blob is uploaded to the server.
7. The server needs to ensure that the request is multipart form data.
8. The server optimizes the image and saves it to a file.
9. The server also initializes the group and finally returns the group ID.
10. The client uses the ID to update the UI and switch over to the new group.

That whole process appears to be working!

For renaming groups, I guess I could use the same form and make the file upload
optional. That's not the most pressing issue though. Group renaming is currently
done through the socket but group creation is done through a HTTP request. I did
that because I wasn't sure about how to send messages to the socket from outside
the socket. Since them, I've worked that out. The logout endpoint gets a
reference to the socket context and kicks a user. Not a problem.

I've had another realisation. Group and user pictures don't change often so we
want to give them a long cache lifetime. But with a long cache lifetime, it
could take a while for changes to appear for every user. We could use the last
modified header but that still requires the browser to check with the server
before using the cache. For a small 1 KB image, this is inefficient. Maybe we
could send a timestamp along with other traffic. Perhaps paired with the user
name.
