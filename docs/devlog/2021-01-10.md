Yesterday, when I implemented leaving groups, I forgot to anonymize the messages
on the database. We can't rely on foreign key constraints in this situation
because we're not deleting the user.

I've been doing a handful of small tasks. I'm just not as excited about this
project as I used to be. Today might be the last day.

I created an ER diagram. Not really any need for it. I just thought I'd make
one.

I started writing the report. I think it would be good for me to take a break
from programming and just play games and watch movies for a few days before
jumping into the next project. Maybe that's why I'm losing motivation. I've been
working hard every day for almost two months. I think I need a few days where I
do nothing and not feel guilty about it.

I also ticked off the last think I had on the task list. That was loading older
messages when you scroll to the top, and purging old messages when there are too
many of them and you aren't looking at them. Refactoring and UI polish are
partially ticked because it's not really possible to complete them. You can just
tweak things indefinitely.

I said this in the report. This is unlikely to be the last day that I work on
this project. I feel like I could tweak things forever but that doesn't seem
like a good use of my time.
