# Chat App Project

- Why I started
  - I didn't want to waste my time during the holidays
  - I wanted to add something to my portfolio that could be shown to employers.
    If you're an employer reading this then, well, I made this for you!
  - I wanted to learn about something new, venture into the unknown
- Challenges I faced and how I overcame them
  - There’s that interesting problem with the date representation that I’m yet 
    to implement as of writing.
  - How do we handle accounts? Google
  - Perhaps also talk about the problems that I didn't solve, or didn't try to
    solve. e.g. roles for users within a group, binary message format, legal
    stuff around deleted users (note in initialize.sql), login with something
    other than google
- Skills I learnt and how I applied them
  - Rust, warp, postgres
  - Database modelling
  - Designing a network protocol
- Some things I would have done better if I started over
  - Better planning from the beginning.
  - Keep notes of my progress throughout the project (so I’m not trying to
    remember what I was thinking a few weeks ago in order to write this report).
  - I decided that I wanted to write this report on 2020-12-26. By that time, at
    lot of progress had been made. I also realised that I should have kept notes
    of my progress but hadn't really done that for the past month. I have commit
    messages and from those I can probably jog my memory and work it out.
- Moving forward
  - Summary.
  - Describe what I can apply to new projects.
  - I'm hoping that for the next project I can try to do something original.
    That is, find a problem and try to solve it with a piece of software.
